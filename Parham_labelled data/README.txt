These files are in xcf (eXperimental Computing Facility) format. I made them using GIMP. you can download GIMP app via https://www.gimp.org/downloads/
Alternatively, I can change the format to photoshop or JPEG.
In each file, there are two layers: the original picture, and the crack layer whivh has a white background with the most obvious crackes labelled. Feel free to edit them!
